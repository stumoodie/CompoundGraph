Java library that supports the representation, traversal, editing and 
manipulation of Directed Compound Graphs. The library can descibe graphs 
with compound nodes *and* compound edges. Nodes can be coloured and edges
can have weights. The graph also can save and restore its state so can
support undo/redo operations.
